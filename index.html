                            Last week Friday, Super Mario Bros. Wonder released on the Nintendo Switch. I pre-ordered the game and was very exited to play it as it strikes a nostalgia chord with my past experience with Mario games; mostly reminding me of New Super Mario Bros. on the DS. Well, this game has been a <i>Wonder</i> to play! (sorry, had to do it...) The game itself is very vibrant and lively and the detail to the games aesthetics are present just playing through the first level of the game. New mechanics, animations, and music are found right from the beginning and really ties the game to be a step in the right direction compared to recent Mario games released. The Wonder effects are fresh and make the gameplay interesting, as everything and anything can change within the level. New enemies are also animated well and have thier own personalities, and its amazing to see how much love and attention Nintendo put into the game. The level design through the game is top-notch, and Nintendo put a lot of thought into the different areas you can find within levels, where to look for Wonder Seeds, and purple 10 coins; getting them is equally as satisfying. I have gotten to beat the main part of the game, but I have yet to 100% everything - the 100% completion goal with getting all the badges is very tempting to do. Overall, the game is awesome, and I can safely say that I recommend this game to anyone!

                    <h3>New IEMs</h3>

                            As a music producer, the quality of sound is very important to music making, and as well as music listening. IEMs, or <u>In Ear Monitors</u>, are a type of in-ear headphones that push out sound and detiail in much better ways than traditional earbuds. They contain large speakers, or drivers, within the buds to push out the sound. I have had two pairs, the Moondrop Chu II and the KZ ZSN Pro X models. These models were relatively cheap for the sound quality so I was very interested to see what the hype was all about!

                            Funny story about how I have two pairs. I originally ordered the Chus around the end of August, from the first party site. Thier main facility is located in China, so international shipping took FOREVER. Two weeks later, they arrive in the mail and I am so excited to try them out! They advertise a flat sound profile, so all the aspects of frequencies in music can be heard clearly. This was the case with the right earbud... but the left was super muddy and did not sound very good. Listening to things make music sound panned hard to the right - something was definitely wrong. I reached out to the manufacturers and they were happy to replace the broken earbud, which I was thankful for! Another two weeks later (a collective month of waiting), the replacement arrives and... the same problem occured.

                            Frustrated, I ordered the ZSN Pros X and am MUCH happier. Just having balanced sound makes things much more enjoyable from a listening standpoint. The sound profile has a little bit of a sharper high end presence, but I am a fan of treble so no issues on that front. The actual hardware is a little bit chunkier than the Chus which took some getting used to but the payoff in the sound was huge; they are now my daily drivers! I also mainly use the Sennheiser HD280 Pros as they are over ear headphones and have a stronger sound presence than both the IEMs, just the sound profile is different as well.
