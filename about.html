                <h2>Who am I?</h2>

                <p>
                    My name is Nickolas Sciortino! Everyobne calls me Nick though. I am a junior-senior at Michigan State University, and my major is Games & Interactive Media with a focus on Game Design. I grew up in Macomb, MI, but currently live closer to East Lansing.

                <p>
                    I am a big gamer and a music fan! I have a Nintendo Switch, and my favorite games include Smash Bros, Mario platformers, The Binding of Isaac, and Animal Crossing. In the music world, I listen to almost everything, but I mainly enjoy game music, EDM, and underground hip-hop. Some of my favorite artists are Toby Fox, JPEGMAFIA, and Tyler, the Creator.

                <p>
                    I also produce music as a hobby! I've been using Ableton Live as my main DAW since I was 16, and plan to work towards learning more programs. I have a comprehensive knowledge of audio production, mixing, mastering, and composition that I've learned myself through the years. I'm also a beginner audiophile and am expanding my knowledge of audio hardware, as different types of sound systems are developing in the world.
